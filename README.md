Welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio!


Hi, I'm Julia! This repository serves to showcase my skills and as a platform to share my projects, and a way to track my progress in Data Analytics and Data Science-related topics.

Tasks and projects solved while passing a Data Analysis course: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Git, SQL, Power BI, Redash, Statistics, A/B-tests, DAU, MAU, ARPU, LTV, CR, Retention and other metrics.

Hope this repo will help you to assess my coding, data analytics and SQL skills or will be just fun for you to look through.
